# Steps

Steps represents the stages of one workflow. Use Timeline for independent historical events.

## Import

Import `Steps`, `Step`, `StepIndicator`, and `StepContent` from the framework package's `primitive/steps` entry (Svelte exposes the four component file entries).

## Core usage

Each `Step` requires a stable, unique `value: string | number`. `current` and `defaultCurrent` refer to that value, never to an array index. Content and indicators are fully composable.

## Props

| Component | Prop           | Type                                                | Default    | Description                                                   |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Steps     | current        | StepValue                                           | -          | Controlled current value.                                     |
| Steps     | defaultCurrent | StepValue                                           | -          | Initial uncontrolled value.                                   |
| Steps     | navigation     | boolean                                             | false      | Enables pointer and keyboard navigation.                      |
| Steps     | orientation    | horizontal \| vertical                              | horizontal | Layout direction.                                             |
| Steps     | responsive     | boolean                                             | true       | Lets horizontal layout become vertical in a narrow container. |
| Steps     | onChange       | (value, meta) => void                               | -          | Navigation request callback.                                  |
| Step      | value          | string \| number                                    | required   | Stable node identity.                                         |
| Step      | disabled       | boolean                                             | false      | Prevents navigation to the node.                              |
| Step      | status         | wait \| process \| finish \| error \| custom string | derived    | Overrides the derived status.                                 |
| Step      | data           | unknown                                             | -          | Business metadata returned in change metadata.                |

## Change metadata

`meta.previous` and `meta.current` contain the complete semantic node snapshot: `value`, resolved `status`, `disabled`, and optional `data`. `meta.trigger` is `pointer` or `keyboard`.

Svelte binds the callback with `onchange={(value, meta) => ...}`. Components are imported from `primitive/steps-root`, `primitive/step`, `primitive/step-indicator`, and `primitive/step-content`; shared types and `createSteps` come from `primitive/steps`.

## Controlled and uncontrolled

With `current`, Steps emits navigation requests and the owner updates the value. With `defaultCurrent`, Steps updates itself. Business completion should update controlled `current` directly.

## Keyboard

When `navigation` is enabled, Enter/Space selects; arrows move focus and selection according to orientation; Home/End select the first/last enabled node. Disabled nodes are skipped.

## Composition notes

Keep business panels outside Steps. Use `StepContent` for arbitrary labels and descriptions and `StepIndicator` for project icons or custom nodes. Responsive behavior uses the Steps container, so it also works inside grids and sidebars.
