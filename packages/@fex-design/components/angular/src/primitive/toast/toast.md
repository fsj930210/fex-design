# Toast Primitive

Import from `@fex-design/angular/primitive/toast`. Use `ToastService` for command calls and mount `fex-toast-viewport` once in the page or app shell.

| `id`             | `string`             | generated | No       | Stable identity for updating one toast instead of adding more.                             |

Hovering a toast pauses its timer. Stack mode only changes presentation; timer policy remains owned by the toast manager. Configure queue limits with `toast.configure({ max })` and set `duration` on individual toast commands. Unknown variants fall back to default styling and keep `data-variant` for custom CSS. Use `toast.destroy(id)` for one toast and `toast.destroy()` for all toasts.
